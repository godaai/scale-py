    "In MPI programming, when processes need to communicate with each other, two fundamental questions must be addressed: \"Who am I in the MPI world?\" and \"Who else is in the MPI world?\" In the MPI standard, [`MPI_Comm_rank`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/mpi-comm-rank-function) defines \"Who am I?\" and [`MPI_COMM_WORLD`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/mpi-comm-size-function) answers \"Who else?\" When starting an MPI program, you should first define a World. This world consists of `size` processes, each assigned a unique number known as rank. Ranks are integers ranging from 0 to `size` - 1. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In MPI, the World refers to the total set of processes involved in parallel computation. In an MPI program, all processes belong to a default communication group known as `MPI_COMM_WORLD`. All processes within this communication group can communicate with each other.\n",

When we start an MPI program, the default communicator (`MPI_COMM_WORLD`) is created, as shown in {numref}`mpi-communicatitor` (a). Each process is assigned a rank number within this communicator, and the numbers on the circles in the diagram represent the rank of processes in this communicator. The same process can be assigned to different communicators, and the rank of the same process in different communicators may be different, as illustrated in {numref}`mpi-communicatitor` (b) and (c). Communication between processes within each communicator is independent. Messages inf one communicator will not affect messages in another. For most MPI programs, there is no need to create other communicators, the predefined `MPI_COMM_WORLD` is sufficient.\n",
