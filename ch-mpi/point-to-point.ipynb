    "# Point-to-Point Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest communication patterns is Point-to-Point communication, which can be further divided into Blocking and Non-Blocking. When implementing Point-to-Point communication, two main considerations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to identify different processes? For example, if you want the process with rank 0 to send a message to the process with rank 1.\n",
    "* What kind of data to send or receive? For example, 1024 integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Send and Receive\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Comm.send`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Comm.html#mpi4py.MPI.Comm.send) and [`Comm.recv`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Comm.html#mpi4py.MPI.Comm.recv) are used for blocking send and receive, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key parameters for `Comm.send(obj, dest, tag=0)` are `obj` and `dest`. `obj` is the data we want to send, and it can be a Python built-in data type such as `list` and `dict`, a NumPy `ndarray`, or even CuPy data on a GPU. In the previous section {ref}`mpi-hello-world`, we introduced communicator and rank, and you can use the rank number to locate a process. `dest` is a rank number. `tag` provides programmers with more control options. For example, the receiver can choose to only receive messages with specific tags.\n",

Non-blocking communication can enhance performance by overlapping communication and computation, i.e., the communications are handled on the network side, meanwhile the computational tasks are performed on the CPU side. The [`isend`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Comm.html#mpi4py.MPI.Comm.isend) and [`irecv`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Comm.html#mpi4py.MPI.Comm.irecv) methods are used for non-blocking communication:\n",

Subsequently, the programmer can perform further processing on the `Request`, such as waiting for the data transfer associated with the `Request` to complete. Non-blocking communication is denoted by an uppercase 'I' or a lowercase 'i', where 'I' is buffer-based and 'i' is not. \n",
    "The function parameters of [`isend`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Comm.html#mpi4py.MPI.Comm.isend) are similar to [`send`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Comm.html#mpi4py.MPI.Comm.send), with the key distinction being that `isend` returns a `Request`. The `Request` class provides a `wait()` method, and explicitly calling `wait()` allows for waiting until the data transfer is complete.
