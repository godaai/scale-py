    "# Remote Memory Access\n",
    "\n",
    "In {numref}`mpi-hello-world`, we introduced two communication modes: two-sided and one-sided. The point-to-point and collective communications discussed in the earlier sections focus on two-sided communication. This section specifically delves into one-sided communication, also known as Remote Memory Access (RMA).\n",

    "## Window\n",
    "\n",
    "Any memory allocated by a process is private, meaning it is only accessible by the process itself. To enable remote memory access, exposing a portion of a process's private memory for access by other processes requires special handling. In MPI, a Window is used to define a memory region that can be accessed remotely. A designated memory region is set to allow remote access, and all processes within the Window can read and write to this shared region. {numref}`rma-window` provides a detailed explanation of private memory regions and windows that can be accessed remotely. The [`mpi4py.MPI.Win`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Win.html#mpi4py.MPI.Win) class in mpi4py facilitates Window-related operations.\n",

    "## Creating a Window\n",
    "\n",
    "Window can be created using [`mpi4py.MPI.Win.Allocate`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Win.html#mpi4py.MPI.Win.Allocate) and [`mpi4py.MPI.Win.Create`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Win.html#mpi4py.MPI.Win.Create). The `mpi4py.MPI.Win.Allocate` method creates a new memory buffer that can be accessed remotely, while `mpi4py.MPI.Win.Create` designates an existing memory buffer for remote access. Specifically, the distinction lies in the first parameter of these two methods: `mpi4py.MPI.Win.Allocate(size)` takes `size` bytes to create a new memory buffer, whereas `mpi4py.MPI.Win.Create(memory)` takes the memory address `memory` of an existing buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read and Write Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a Window with remote access is created, three types of methods can be used to read and write data to the memory region: [`mpi4py.MPI.Win.Put`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Win.html#mpi4py.MPI.Win.Put), [`mpi4py.MPI.Win.Get`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Win.html#mpi4py.MPI.Win.Get), and [`mpi4py.MPI.Win.Accumulate`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.Win.html#mpi4py.MPI.Win.Accumulate). These methods all take two parameters: `origin` and `target_rank`, representing the source process and the target process, respectively. The source process is the one invoking the read/write method, while the target process is the remote process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Win.Put` moves data from the origin process to the target process.\n",
    "- `Win.Get` moves data from the target process to the origin process.\n",
    "- `Win.Accumulate` is similar to `Win.Put`, moving data from the origin process to the target process, while also performing an aggregation operation on the data from the source and target processes. Aggregation operators include [`mpi4py.MPI.SUM`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.SUM.html), [`mpi4py.MPI.PROD`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/mpi4py.MPI.PROD.html), and others.\n",

    "## Data Synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "In a single-machine program, execution is sequential. However, in a multi-machine environment where multiple processes are involved in reading and writing data, data synchronization issues may arise. As illustrated in {numref}`rma-sync-problem`, without explicit control over the order of read and write operations, the data in a particular memory region may not yield the expected results.\n",
